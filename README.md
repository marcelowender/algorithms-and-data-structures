# Algorithms and data structures

In this repository are the main algorithms and data structures.<br>

These represent a series of studies based initially on the course:  [BootCamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-bootcamp/)

With the idea of fixing the content learned in these studies, I am using the technique of spaced repetition.
<br><br>This technique consists of performing minor revisions of content from time to time.

For this I am using the tool. 
[Studie](https://studieapp.com)

Using this tool I created a course with flashcards and various questions to validate the knowledge gained throughout the modules.
We can see [HERE](https://studieapp.com/my/courses/290) the course

I used the exercises of the site  [GeeksForGeeks](https://auth.geeksforgeeks.org/user/marcelowender/profile) the course  to fix the course knowledge

# Algorithms and data structures

In this repository are the main algorithms and data structures.<br>

These represent a series of studies based initially on the course:  [BootCamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-bootcamp/)

With the idea of fixing the content learned in these studies, I am using the technique of spaced repetition.
<br><br>This technique consists of performing minor revisions of content from time to time.

For this I am using the tool.
